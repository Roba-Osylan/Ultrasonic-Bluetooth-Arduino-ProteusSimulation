# Ultrasonic-Bluetooth-Arduino-ProteusSimulation
In the previous project (see https://github.com/Roba-Osylan/Controlling-6-ServoMotors-RestaurantRobot-sArm), the circuit that controls the movements of the robot's arms was designed. Through this project three two components will be added to the circuit in order to make it more efficient. The first component that will be added is the Ultrasonic sensor. Ultrasonic sensors are used to measure distances using ultrasonic waves and they are consist of trigger pin, echo pin, the 5V and ground pins. The simple operation of the ultrasonic sensor is that the trigger (or transmitter) transmits the ultrasonic wave, then the echo (or receiver) receives the reflected wave after it hits an object. While the wave is traveling between the transmitter and the receiver, the ultrasonic measure the traveling time and use this information to measure the distanse by the fact that
